# Nvim Configuration

These are my nvim configuration files.

Maybe because I like doing things all by myself, or maybe because
I started my vim journey with Drew Neil's excellent *Practical
Vim* (in which he advises that one learn vim really well before
extending it with plugins), this is all hand-written by yours
truly,[^1] and it's probably not very helpful *for the most part*.

*But*, I will say that aside from a little bit of scripting and
some hobbyist programming projects, I use nvim for writing, not
for coding. If you happen to be in the same position, there might
be a useful idea here for you here and there.

[^1]: Notable exception: Syntax highlighting for `fish` scripts,
  written in vimscript; there is no attribution in the file.
  Thanks, whoever I got that from!
