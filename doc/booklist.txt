NINETEENTH-CENTURY AMERICAN LITERATURE              *booklist-19th*

The purpose of this list is to establish a more thorough
understanding of American literature of the nineteenth century,
with particular emphasis on how the texts on the list anticipate
philosophical and psychological questions that preoccupy later
thinkers and that continue to be posed today. Of particular
interest to me is the fact that twentieth-century critics return
to these texts because they detect a sense of urgency in the way
they pose their questions; they see them as "equipment for
living," as Kenneth Burke writes. Literary writing directed its
attention to the fabricatedness of what one can know about truth,
one's others, and one's self, yet urged these doubts, not as
crippling, but as orienting in relation to the world.

AMERICAN MODERNISM                             *booklist-modernism*

The rationale for this list is twofold. First, it covers an array
of significant modernist texts, extending my field expertise
beyond the nineteenth century into the early twentieth. Second,
it affords the opportunity to explore linkages between how these
texts work and contemporaneous developments in American
philosophical thinking, which I understand to be anticipated by
developments in the fiction of the nineteenth century.
