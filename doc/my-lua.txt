my-lua.txt              Lua's syntax is sometimes not what I
                        expect it to be. Hopefully I will
                        remember to document these surprises
                        here.

=================================================================
LUA NOT EQUAL                               *lua-not-equal* *lua-neq*

It's not `!=`, it's `~=`.
